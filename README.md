# Drima Browser MCP

A local, visible browser controlled through MCP. No required extension, subscription,
cloud relay, feature tier, or API key. Independently implemented using the official
MCP Python SDK and Playwright; no Blueprint code is included.

One service owns a persistent Firefox profile (Chromium is also supported). Codex, Kimi and the diagnostic
CLI connect through it. Disconnecting an agent does not close the browser. All
tools use stable tab IDs and explicit locators. Mutating batches stop on the first
error, report completed actions, and never automatically repeat a submission.

## Install and run

Requires Python 3.12+, uv and a graphical desktop for visible mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drima-code/drima-browser-mcp.git
cd drima-browser-mcp
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen playwright install firefox chromium --no-shell
uv run --frozen drima-browser serve
```

In another terminal:

```bash
uv run --frozen drima-browser call browser_open '{"url":"https://www.getonbrd.com"}'
uv run --frozen drima-browser call browser_tabs
```

For a service that stays available across agent restarts and starts at login:

```bash
uv run --frozen python scripts/install_user_service.py
systemctl --user status drima-browser
```

Stop a foreground server before installing the service; both use port 8766.
The service starts without launching Firefox; the first `browser_open` opens it.
Sign in normally in that window. CAPTCHA and identity checks are completed by the
user. Accounts from your existing Firefox profile are not imported or read. Some sites may reject
automation-controlled browsers or OAuth flows; this server does not bypass them.

The dedicated headed Firefox window is hidden from focus and normal Alt-Tab space
shortly after launch when `wmctrl` is available. Browser actions continue in the
background; bring the window forward with the desktop window switcher when a
CAPTCHA or sign-in needs to be completed.

## MCP client configuration

Point a stdio client to the installed executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drima-browser": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/drima-browser-mcp/.venv/bin/drima-browser",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Codex registration:

```bash
codex mcp add drima-browser -- /absolute/path/drima-browser-mcp/.venv/bin/drima-browser stdio
```

Kimi supports a project `.mcp.json` or user `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` in the installed
version. Merge this server into existing configuration rather than replacing
unrelated servers. Restart/reload the MCP client to discover newly registered tools.
The diagnostic CLI is available immediately, even before client rediscovery.

The stdio proxy loads its local token from disk; no credential is stored in these
client configuration examples. The service must be running first. Service startup
and browser startup are separate, so errors are easy to diagnose.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `browser_status` | Service/browser status and persistent-profile location |
| `browser_open` | Create a tab and start the browser if needed |
| `browser_tabs` | List, focus or close tabs using stable IDs |
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate, back, forward or reload |
| `browser_snapshot` | Compact accessibility tree and form metadata; bounded output |
| `browser_act` | Batch fill, click, select, check, uncheck, press, hover, scroll |
| `browser_upload` | Upload up to 10 explicit local files, up to 25 MiB each |
| `browser_screenshot` | JPEG as an MCP image, viewport or full page |
| `browser_evaluate` | Explicit JavaScript evaluation in a selected page |
| `browser_dialog` | Inspect, accept or dismiss alert/confirm/prompt dialogs |
| `browser_wait` | Bounded wait for an element state |
| `browser_events` | Bounded console/errors and network response metadata |
| `browser_downloads` | List saved downloads and their status |
| `browser_close` | Close only the dedicated browser; retain its profile |

Locators use exactly one of `selector`, `role` + optional `name`, `label`, or `text`.
Names/text are exact matches. An optional `frame` CSS selector scopes a locator to
an iframe. Duplicate matches fail rather than choosing the first. The accessibility
tree's role/name is often more reliable than label text for wrapped dropdowns.

```json
{
  "tab_id": "ID_FROM_BROWSER_TABS",
  "actions": [
    {"action":"fill","target":{"label":"Full name"},"value":"Alex Sample"},
    {"action":"select","target":{"role":"combobox","name":"Language"},"value":"en"}
  ]
}
```

`fill` replaces field content without pressing Enter. `select` takes the option
**value** from the snapshot. Keep final submission in a separate call, record
unknown outcome before clicking, and verify a receipt afterwards. A successful
click only confirms a browser action, not acceptance by an employer's server.

For screenshots using the CLI:

```bash
uv run --frozen drima-browser call browser_screenshot \
  '{"tab_id":"ID"}' --image-output /tmp/browser.jpg
```

## Local data and access

Default directory: `~/.local/share/drima-browser` (mode 0700), overridable with
`DRIMA_BROWSER_DATA` or `--data-dir` before the command. It contains the browser
profile, mode-0600 client token, and downloads. None belongs in git.

The HTTP endpoint binds only to `127.0.0.1:8766`, requires a bearer token, rejects
Origin-bearing web requests, and uses SDK host validation. The trusted local MCP
client can read/interact with pages, evaluate JavaScript and upload explicitly
named files; it is not a sandbox for an untrusted local agent. User-facing pages
remain untrusted data, never instructions for the agent. Console text may contain
site-provided private data; request headers/bodies and query strings are not logged.

Calls are serialized, but this is not a multi-agent task scheduler: coordinate
which agent owns a workflow, especially across human CAPTCHA/login pauses. Tabs
and screenshots have no subscription cap. There is no stealth mode, CAPTCHA
solver, OAuth bypass, or claim of complete Blueprint feature parity.

## Verification

```bash
uv run --frozen pytest -q
uv run --frozen python scripts/smoke_transport.py
uv run --frozen python scripts/smoke_regular_upload.py
uv run --frozen ruff check src tests scripts
```

Tests use synthetic pages in real headless Firefox and Chromium. The transport smoke test
starts a temporary authenticated HTTP service and reconnects two stdio clients,
verifying tool discovery, image forwarding and browser continuity. No real
application is submitted by tests. Linux is the tested deployment; systemd
installation is Linux-specific. Playwright uses its Ubuntu fallback build on Arch.

## Browser selection

Firefox is the default. To select Chromium, run `drima-browser serve --browser chromium`.
Each engine has a separate persistent profile. Google rejected sign-in in the
initial Chromium session; changing engines does not guarantee OAuth acceptance.
Use the site’s supported login methods and leave account verification to the user.

### Google sign-in rejected

Google may reject automation-controlled browsers even when the user types the
credentials manually. Firefox does not guarantee acceptance. Use the destination
site's supported email/password login or account recovery instead. If the account
only supports Google, sign in through your regular, non-automated browser and
complete that site's workflow there. Do not disable account security, spoof the
browser, or copy authentication cookies to work around rejection.
See [Google's supported-browser guidance](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7675428).

## Optional connector for your regular Firefox (experimental)

The Firefox extension is named **MCP Browser Bridge**. Its source is in
`extension/` and is distributed under this repository's MIT license. It requires
Firefox 142+ for built-in data-transfer consent. See [privacy notice](PRIVACY.md):
approved page content goes to your local MCP client, which may send it to its AI
provider depending on that client's configuration.
It also requires
the local native host below; installing the extension alone is not sufficient.
For permanent installation, follow [the signing and install guide](PERMANENT_INSTALL.md).
Build an upload ZIP with `uv run --frozen python scripts/package_extension.py`,
get it signed by Mozilla (unlisted/self-distribution is sufficient), then install
the signed XPI through `about:addons`. A public store listing is being prepared;
no approved Mozilla listing is claimed yet.

The default MCP launches a separate profile and cannot attach to an already-running
normal Firefox. This connector instead uses Firefox's supported extension/native
messaging APIs, keeping existing sessions in that browser. **Manual per-tab approval
is the default**, on any regular HTTP/HTTPS website. The toolbar popup also offers
explicit opt-in automatic access to all current and future regular website tabs.
It does not copy cookies, spoof automation or change account security. It cannot
bypass Firefox's protected-page restrictions. Private tabs, file URLs and internal
browser pages are excluded.

```bash
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen python scripts/install_regular_connector.py
```

In your normal Firefox, open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click
**Load Temporary Add-on**, and select this checkout's `extension/manifest.json`.
Open the toolbar popup and click **Approve this tab**: **ON** indicates approval;
use **Revoke this tab** to stop it. Leaving the approved origin revokes approval.
For automatic mode, acknowledge its privacy warning and click **Enable automatic
access**, then accept Firefox's optional website permission prompt. **ALL** marks
that mode, which persists across restarts. **Switch to manual** stops automatic
access and removes those optional permissions. The native MCP client cannot change
the access mode. No built-in tab-count cap; resource/message-size limits still apply.
An **ERR** badge indicates a native-host connection problem. Temporary extensions
unload when Firefox restarts; permanent installation requires Mozilla signing.

Use a separate MCP entry with command `/absolute/path/.venv/bin/drima-browser`
and args `["regular-stdio"]`. Existing `stdio` stays on the dedicated browser.
For immediate diagnostics without client rediscovery:

```bash
uv run --frozen drima-browser regular-call tabs
uv run --frozen drima-browser regular-call snapshot '{"tab_id":"APPROVED_ID"}'
```

Available tools: approved-tab listing, bounded top-frame snapshots and single
strict-selector click/fill/select/check/uncheck actions. Password/token controls
blocked. Snapshots include strict CSS selectors, current checkbox state and attached filenames.
Actions reject read-only/disabled controls and report failed value changes.
The popup includes **Reconnect native host** for dropped connections without
replaying website actions. No arbitrary JS evaluation, network interception or
automatic retries. Version 0.2.2 adds **regular_browser_upload** for explicit
absolute local paths: up to 10 files and 25 MiB combined. Files are sent in bounded
chunks; only the final commit attaches them and triggers the site's upload events.
Only filenames and file contents reach the approved tab; local paths stay local.
The input's type filter, disabled state and multi-file setting are checked. Visible
inputs and hidden inputs with visible associated labels are supported. Snapshots
include their selectors, accepted types and selected filenames.

```bash
uv run --frozen drima-browser regular-call upload \
  '{"tab_id":"APPROVED_ID","selector":"#resume","paths":["/absolute/path/resume.pdf"]}'
```

Attach only files the user has authorized for that site. Selection can start an
upload immediately; it does not prove the employer accepted the application.
Inspect filenames and page validation before submitting. A timeout or navigation
change must be inspected before any retry. No directory uploads or file-picker
automation. Iframe uploads and sites requiring trusted picker events remain manual.
The user still handles login/CAPTCHA/assessments.

Install the Mozilla-signed **0.2.2** update with the same extension ID. The local
Python code is available immediately through the diagnostic CLI above; reconnect
Codex's regular MCP server if its tool list still lacks `regular_browser_upload`.
The installed-extension smoke test uses a disposable Firefox profile and a local
synthetic form; it never touches user accounts or real applications.

Linux only: native host uses a mode-0600 Unix socket inside a mode-0700 user-owned
directory. It is a trusted-user local bridge, not isolation from same-user malware.
No HTTP listener or external relay. Install only in a browser you control.
